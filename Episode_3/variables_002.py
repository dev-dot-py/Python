"""
In this exercise we will assign values to variables and print the value to the terminal
to verify its value, then we will change the values of our variables in memory and print
them again to verify the values changed
"""


# first assign a value to a variable, here we assign 'x' the value of '10'
x = 10

# now assign another value to a variable, here we assign 'y' the value of '20'
y = 20

# now print the values of your variables
print(x)
print(y)

# now we want to change the values of these variables in memory
# change the value of 'x' to '30' and change the value of 'y' to '40'
x = 30
y = 40

# now print the values and verify the updated values of your variables!
print(x)
print(y)

# you should see that 'x' is now 30 and 'y' is now 40, this happened because we
# changed the value respectively after we had initialized the first values of 10 and 20
# earlier in the script processing
