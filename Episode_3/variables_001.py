"""
In this exercise we will assign values to variables and print the value to the terminal
to verify its value
"""


# first assign a value to a variable, here we assign 'x' the value of '10'
x = 10

# now assign another value to a variable, here we assign 'y' the value of '20'
y = 20

# not print the values of your variables
print(x)
print(y)

# now run this script, you can see that the console prints out the value of 10 first and then
# the value of 20 on the next line, code is interpreted in a top down fastion starting at line 1
# so after we assigned the values to our variables we printed the x value first on line 14 and
# then printed the y value second on line 15
