# DEV.py - Episode 3: Variables

In this episode we begin learning by understanding variables and how they're used
in python.

Variables allow us to store information in memory while processing our code.
We can assign a value to a variable and reference it later as needed throughout our code.

We can also change the value in memory, allowing us to use variables for calculations.
